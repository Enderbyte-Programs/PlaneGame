LAUNCHER
When you first start the launcher, you will probably need to dismiss "unrecognized publisher" warnings. I assure you that it is safe.
On first execution, it will take much longer than usual. This is to dump DLLs and download files. (takes about 20 seconds max) You can see details in the latest.log file in the same directory. You should also see a small window that says "downloading files". It may say "not reponding", but if that happens click "wait for program to respond".
